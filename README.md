## JX1
An additive wavetable synthesiser written in c using the portaudio library. At the moment the synth has the ability to create saw, sine and square waves and mix them together with an envelope and filter. The synth is played on computer keyboard (only one octave atm). Will eventually rewrite something like this in juce.
